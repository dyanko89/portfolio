## Overview

This international commodity trading platform facilitates B2B2C transactions for a regulated resource across multiple jurisdictions. I led the complete rebuild of the platform, redesigning the database architecture, API layer, and React frontend to support complex multi-currency operations while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

The existing platform had accumulated significant technical debt:

- Monolithic codebase with tightly coupled components
- Database design that couldn't scale with transaction volume
- No clear separation between B2B and B2C workflows
- Compliance tracking scattered across multiple systems

## Database Architecture

The rebuild centered on a properly normalized relational schema:

### Scale
- **52 tables** covering entities, transactions, inventory, and compliance
- **77 foreign key relationships** ensuring referential integrity
- **3.7M+ rows** in production with optimized query patterns

### Core Entities
```
Organizations ──┬── Users ──── Permissions
                │
                ├── Products ── Inventory
                │
                └── Transactions ── Line Items
                                      │
                                      └── Compliance Records
```

### Key Design Decisions

**Multi-Currency Support**
- Separate currency and exchange rate tables
- Transaction amounts stored in both local and base currency
- Audit trail for all currency conversions

**Regulatory Compliance**
- Every transaction linked to compliance checkpoint records
- Document storage with version history
- Automated reporting exports per jurisdiction

## API Architecture

Node.js/TypeScript backend with RESTful design:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Organization-level data isolation

### Transaction Processing
- Atomic operations for multi-step transactions
- Optimistic locking for inventory management
- Event sourcing for audit trail

## Frontend Architecture

React frontend with complex state management:

### Multi-View Filtering
- Saved filter presets per user
- Real-time inventory availability
- Bulk operations support

### Responsive Dashboard
- Key metrics visualization
- Transaction timeline
- Compliance status indicators

## Technical Highlights

**Performance Optimization**
- Query optimization reducing average response time by 60%
- Pagination and lazy loading for large datasets
- Connection pooling for database efficiency

**Developer Experience**
- TypeScript throughout the stack
- Generated API documentation
- Comprehensive integration test suite

## Results

The rebuilt platform successfully supports:
- Active trading operations across multiple countries
- Thousands of transactions processed monthly
- Full regulatory audit capabilities
- Sub-second response times for complex queries
