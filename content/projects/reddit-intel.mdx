# Reddit Intelligence Platform

*AI-Powered Market Intelligence SaaS*

## Overview

A B2B platform that makes Reddit intelligence accessible to any business. Instead of requiring technical setup, users describe their industry through a conversational AI experience — the system handles subreddit discovery, content monitoring, and analysis delivery automatically.

## The Problem

Reddit is one of the richest sources of unfiltered market intelligence, but extracting value from it is hard:

- **Signal-to-noise ratio** is terrible without domain expertise
- **Manual monitoring** doesn't scale across communities
- **Traditional market research** costs $10K+ per report
- **Existing tools** require technical users who know which subreddits to track

## Solution: Chat-First Intelligence

The platform flips the typical approach. Instead of asking users to configure scrapers and pick subreddits, an AI conversation guides the entire setup:

1. **User describes their business** in natural language
2. **AI discovers relevant subreddits** and ranks them by relevance
3. **Intelligent search** generates targeted queries from business goals
4. **Analysis engine** produces actionable briefs with evidence

## Key Features

### Conversational Onboarding
Users don't need to know Reddit. The AI chat:
- Asks about industry, audience, and intelligence goals
- Discovers and suggests relevant subreddits
- Configures monitoring automatically
- Explains what it will track and why

### AI-Powered Search Strategy
Rather than scraping entire subreddits, the system generates focused search queries from business context — reducing noise by 83% and keeping analysis costs under $1 per report.

### Five Analysis Types

| Type | Delivers |
|------|----------|
| Comprehensive | Full market overview with themes and patterns |
| Pain Points | Top challenges with confidence scoring |
| Opportunities | Service opportunities matched to user profile |
| Dual Perspective | Separate analysis for multiple stakeholders |
| Trends | Emerging patterns backed by evidence |

### Profile Modes
Users select how they'll use the intelligence:

- **Content Creator** → blog ideas, LinkedIn posts, newsletter topics with Reddit evidence
- **Consultant** → service opportunities, pitch angles, engagement strategies

Each mode tailors the output format, tone, and recommendations.

### Evidence-Based Citations
Every insight links back to its source — Reddit posts with upvote counts, timestamps, and direct URLs. No black-box analysis.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React Query
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy (async)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Cache**: Redis for session and scrape data
- **Auth**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Payments**: Stripe subscription billing
- **AI**: Claude API for analysis and onboarding

### System Flow

## Current State

The platform is in active development with core infrastructure deployed:
- Full-stack deployed (Vercel + Railway + Supabase)
- User registration, auth, and session management working
- Database schema (12 tables) with seed data
- Analysis engine production-tested across multiple verticals
- Payment integration in progress

## What's Next

- Complete Stripe subscription flow
- Build out the chat onboarding UI
- Add scheduled monitoring with email delivery
- Historical trend comparison (week-over-week)
