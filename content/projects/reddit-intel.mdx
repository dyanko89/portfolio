# Reddit Market Intelligence

*Market Intelligence Platform*

## Overview

The Reddit Market Intelligence system monitors 13 industry subreddits for market trends, consumer sentiment, and business opportunities. Using Claude AI for analysis, it generates professional dual-perspective reports with evidence-based citations, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## The Challenge

The industry moves fast:

- **Regulatory changes** happen frequently
- **Consumer preferences** shift rapidly
- **Market opportunities** emerge and disappear quickly
- **Competitive intelligence** is scattered across forums

Traditional market research is:
- Expensive ($10K+ per report)
- Slow (weeks to months)
- Often outdated by publication

## Key Features

### Multi-Subreddit Monitoring
Tracking 13 relevant subreddits:
- r/weedbiz
- r/[industry-specific]
- r/canadients
- r/TheOCS
- And 9 more industry-specific communities

### Content Extraction
```python
def extract_relevant_posts(subreddit: str, timeframe: str) -> List[Post]:
    """Extract posts with business relevance"""
    posts = reddit.subreddit(subreddit).top(timeframe)

    return [
        post for post in posts
        if meets_relevance_criteria(post)
        and has_engagement_threshold(post)
    ]
```

### AI-Powered Analysis
Claude analyzes aggregated content for:
- **Market Trends**: What's gaining/losing popularity
- **Consumer Pain Points**: Unmet needs and complaints
- **Competitive Intelligence**: What companies are being discussed
- **Regulatory Signals**: Policy changes and impacts

### Dual-Perspective Reports
Two professional personas provide analysis:

**Danny** - The Opportunist
- Focuses on business opportunities
- Aggressive growth recommendations
- First-mover advantage emphasis

**Basil** - The Analyst
- Risk-aware perspective
- Data-driven recommendations
- Conservative market positioning

### Evidence-Based Citations
Every claim links to source:
```markdown
## Market Trend: Vape Decline

Consumer sentiment around vape products has shifted negatively,
with health concerns driving preference toward flower and edibles.

**Sources:**
- [r/canadients] "Switching back to flower after..." (342 upvotes)
- [r/TheOCS] "Edibles are the only way to go now" (189 upvotes)
```

### DOCX Report Generation
Professional branded documents:
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings by category
- Opportunity matrix
- Source appendix

## Technical Implementation

### Reddit API Integration
```python
import praw

reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id=config.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=config.REDDIT_SECRET,
    user_agent="MarketIntel/2.0"
)
```

### Content Processing Pipeline
1. **Scrape**: Collect posts from target subreddits
2. **Filter**: Remove noise, duplicates, irrelevant content
3. **Aggregate**: Group by topic and sentiment
4. **Analyze**: Claude AI extracts insights
5. **Generate**: Create formatted DOCX report

### Report Automation
```python
from docx import Document
from docx.shared import Inches, Pt

def generate_report(analysis: Analysis) -> Document:
    doc = Document('template.docx')

    add_executive_summary(doc, analysis.summary)
    add_trend_section(doc, analysis.trends)
    add_opportunity_matrix(doc, analysis.opportunities)
    add_citations(doc, analysis.sources)

    return doc
```

## Results

The system delivers:

- **Weekly intelligence reports**
- **20+ actionable insights** per report
- **100% citation coverage**
- **$5K-50K+ deal opportunities** identified

### Use Cases
- New market entry decisions
- Product development priorities
- Competitive positioning
- Regulatory preparedness
