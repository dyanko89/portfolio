# Canada Beef Branding Automation

*Enterprise Content Automation*

## Overview

The Canada Beef Branding Automation system transforms master training presentations into retailer-specific branded versions automatically. What previously took 20+ hours of manual work now completes in 5-10 minutes, enabling rapid deployment of training materials to 7+ retail partners.

## The Problem

Canada Beef produces training materials for multiple retail partners, each requiring:

- **Custom branding** (logos, colors, partner names)
- **Consistent quality** across all materials
- **Rapid turnaround** for partner requests
- **Multiple output formats** (slides, Brainshark modules)

Manual rebranding was:
- Extremely time-consuming (20+ hours per partner)
- Error-prone (missed slides, inconsistent styling)
- Difficult to scale (new partners = repeat all work)

## Solution Architecture

```
Master PPTX (292 slides)
         |
    Python Processor
         |
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   |     |     |
 Logo  Color  Text
Replace Match Replace
   |     |     |
   └─────┬─────┘
         |
    51 Output Files
    (Brainshark-ready)
```

## Key Features

### Dynamic Logo Replacement
Intelligent logo detection and replacement:
- Position-aware placement
- Automatic sizing to match original
- Transparency handling for complex logos

### Fuzzy Color Matching
```python
def match_brand_color(source_color: RGB, brand_palette: List[RGB]) -> RGB:
    """Find closest brand color using LAB color space"""
    source_lab = rgb_to_lab(source_color)

    best_match = min(
        brand_palette,
        key=lambda c: delta_e(source_lab, rgb_to_lab(c))
    )

    return best_match
```

Handles color variations in source files:
- Gradient colors
- Slight color variations
- Theme vs. explicit colors

### Text Token Replacement
Partner-specific text replacement:
- Company names
- Contact information
- Custom messaging
- Slide-specific content

### Batch Processing
Single execution processes entire presentation:
- 292 slides analyzed
- 51 output files generated
- Full audit log created

## Technical Implementation

### PPTX Processing
```python
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt

def process_slide(slide, brand_config):
    # Process shapes
    for shape in slide.shapes:
        if shape.has_text_frame:
            replace_text(shape, brand_config.text_map)

        if is_logo(shape):
            replace_logo(shape, brand_config.logo_path)

        if has_fill_color(shape):
            remap_color(shape, brand_config.color_map)
```

### Image Processing
Pillow for logo manipulation:
- Resize to match original dimensions
- Handle transparency (PNG with alpha)
- Color space conversion when needed

### VBA Macro Injection
Brainshark-ready outputs include:
- Navigation macros
- Timing configuration
- Audio sync points

## Results

The automation delivers:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Time per partner | 20+ hours | 5-10 minutes |
| Error rate | ~5% | Under 0.1% |
| Partners supported | 3 | 7+ |
| Scalability | Limited | Unlimited |

### Efficiency Gain
**97% reduction** in processing time

### Quality Improvement
- Consistent branding across all slides
- Zero missed replacements
- Audit trail for verification

## Sample Output

For each retail partner, the system produces:
- 51 individual PPTX modules
- Named with partner prefix
- Brainshark macro-enabled
- Ready for immediate deployment
