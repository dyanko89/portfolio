# CCX Database Backup System

*Production Disaster Recovery*

## Overview

The CCX Backup System is an automated disaster recovery solution for a production trading platform. Running daily at 5:45 PM, it creates compressed backups of the entire database, uploads to AWS S3, and maintains a retention policy - all with email notifications on success or failure.

## The Problem

The CCX trading platform manages critical business data:

- **3.7 million rows** of transaction history
- **52 tables** of operational data
- **Regulatory requirements** for data retention
- **Business continuity** needs for rapid recovery

Without proper backups, a database failure could mean:
- Loss of transaction records
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Significant business disruption

## Solution Architecture

```
SQL Server Database
       |
   [Daily 5:45 PM]
       |
  Node.js Backup Service
       |
   ┌───┴───┐
   |       |
 Compress  Validate
   |       |
   └───┬───┘
       |
   AWS S3 Upload
       |
   Email Notification
```

### Backup Process

1. **Connection**: Secure connection to SQL Server via credentials from AWS Secrets Manager
2. **Export**: Table-by-table data extraction with transaction consistency
3. **Compression**: GZIP compression reducing ~40MB raw to ~8.7MB
4. **Upload**: Encrypted upload to S3 with versioning enabled
5. **Notification**: Success/failure email via AWS SES

## Technical Implementation

### Data Volume
```
Production Statistics:
- Tables: 52
- Total Rows: 3,744,892
- Largest Table: 2.1M rows (transaction_lines)
- Backup Size: ~8.7 MB compressed
- Backup Duration: ~45 seconds
```

### AWS Integration

**S3 Storage**
- Versioned bucket for point-in-time recovery
- Lifecycle rules for cost optimization
- Cross-region replication for DR

**Secrets Manager**
- Database credentials rotated quarterly
- IAM role-based access
- No secrets in code or config files

**SES Notifications**
- Success emails with backup statistics
- Failure alerts with error details
- Branded HTML templates

### Scheduling

```ini
# systemd timer for daily backups
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 17:45:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

## Recovery Capabilities

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Target**: Under 10 minutes
- **Tested**: 7 minutes average
- **Process**: Download, decompress, restore

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Maximum data loss**: 24 hours
- **Backup frequency**: Daily
- **Retention**: 90 days

### Recovery Procedure
1. Download latest backup from S3
2. Verify checksum integrity
3. Decompress backup file
4. Restore to SQL Server instance
5. Validate row counts against manifest

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Success Metrics Tracked
- Backup duration
- Compressed file size
- Row counts per table
- S3 upload confirmation

### Failure Handling
- Immediate email alert on any error
- Error details and stack trace included
- Manual intervention instructions

## Results

Since deployment:

- **100% backup success rate**
- **Zero data loss incidents**
- **Full compliance** with regulatory requirements
- **Proven recovery** during planned DR tests
