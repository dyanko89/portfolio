# Email Triage Assistant

*Production System - Running 24/7*

## Overview

The Email Triage Assistant is an intelligent automation system that eliminates the daily burden of email management. By combining Claude AI's classification capabilities with a robust rules engine, it transforms incoming emails into actionable tasks without human intervention.

## The Problem

Professional teams face a constant battle with email overload:

- Critical requests buried in promotional noise
- Action items forgotten in long thread chains
- Context lost when forwarding emails to project tools
- Hours wasted on manual sorting and task creation

## The Solution

A production-grade system that runs continuously on personal VPN infrastructure, processing emails every 15 minutes:

### Intelligent Classification

Claude AI analyzes each email against a trained skill matrix, determining:
- **Category**: Client request, internal task, notification, spam
- **Priority**: Urgent, high, normal, low
- **Routing**: Which team member or workflow should handle it
- **Action Type**: Requires response, task creation, or archive

### Automated Task Creation

When an email requires action, the system:
1. Extracts key details (deadline, stakeholders, requirements)
2. Links relevant SOPs for self-service resolution
3. Creates properly formatted Asana tasks
4. Attaches the original email for context
5. Assigns based on skill-based routing matrix

### Key Components

**Email Monitor Service**
- Systemd service running on Debian 12 VPN server
- Polls Microsoft Graph API every 15 minutes
- Tracks processed emails to prevent duplicates

**AI Classification Engine**
- Claude 3.5 Haiku for cost-effective classification
- Custom prompt engineering for business context
- Structured output parsing for reliable routing

**Rules Database**
- SQLite for routing rules and client associations
- Configurable skill matrix for team assignments
- SOP linking for common request types

## Results

The system has been running in production since late 2024:

- **~30 minutes saved daily** on email processing
- **100% capture rate** of actionable items
- **Zero missed** client requests since deployment
- **24/7 operation** with email failure alerts

## Technical Highlights

- **Stateless Design**: Each poll is independent, enabling easy recovery
- **Failure Resilience**: AWS SES notifications on any processing errors
- **Context Preservation**: Full email thread linked to every task
- **Cost Optimized**: Haiku model keeps AI costs under $5/month
