## The Challenge

A major retail chain needed to onboard 500+ new employees monthly across 200+ locations. Their existing training process was manual, inconsistent, and couldn't scale with rapid expansion.

## The Solution

I built an end-to-end automated learning management system that transforms training scripts into fully-produced SCORM-compliant courses.

### Key Features

**Automated Content Pipeline**
- Script-to-course generation with AI narration
- Branded template system for consistent look and feel
- Version control for content updates across all locations
- Quality assurance workflows with approval gates

**Technical Implementation**
- Python-based processing engine
- ElevenLabs integration for natural voice narration
- AWS S3 for scalable content delivery
- SCORM 1.2 compliance for LMS integration

## Results

- **90% reduction** in course production time
- **500+ employees** onboarded monthly
- **100% SCORM compliance** across all modules
- **Zero manual intervention** required for standard updates
