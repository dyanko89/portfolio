## Overview

A personal infrastructure backbone running on Debian 12 with WireGuard VPN for secure remote access. Hosts multiple production automation services with high availability and automatic recovery.

## Infrastructure Purpose

### Secure Remote Access
- WireGuard VPN for encrypted tunneling
- Multiple client device support
- Split tunneling options for specific services

### Production Service Hosting
Hosts mission-critical automation services including:
- AI-powered email classification
- Scheduled data sync pipelines
- Automated backup systems

## Technical Stack

### Operating System
- **Debian 12 (Bookworm)** - Stable, security-focused
- Automated security updates
- Minimal attack surface

### Service Management
All services run as systemd units with automatic restart:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Production Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=automation
WorkingDirectory=/opt/service
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Service Architecture

### Process Isolation
- Each service runs under dedicated user account
- Separate working directories
- Environment-based configuration

### Logging & Monitoring
- journald for centralized service logs
- Custom log rotation policies
- Email alerts on service failures

### Scheduled Operations
Cron-based scheduling for automation services with staggered execution times to avoid resource contention.

## Reliability Features

### Automatic Recovery
- systemd auto-restart on failures
- Health check endpoints for critical services
- Watchdog integration for long-running processes

### Backup Strategy
- Configuration backups to separate storage
- Service state snapshots before updates
- Documented recovery procedures

## Security Posture

### Access Control
- SSH key-only authentication
- Fail2ban for intrusion prevention
- Firewall rules allowing only necessary ports

### Updates
- Unattended security updates enabled
- Quarterly maintenance windows for major updates
- Rollback procedures documented

## Operational Stats

- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ over past 6 months
- **Active VPN Clients**: 3
- **Production Services**: 3
- **Monthly Data Processed**: ~500GB
